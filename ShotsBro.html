    <h2>Woah, this looks pro. Is this from a show?</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, these cartoons were made for a kid's show in New Zealand called Kea
      Kids News. I have worked on the show for five seasons, and have made 230
      animations for the show, totalling almost two hours in runtime.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I see more animations?</h2>
    <p>
      Best thing to do is check out my vimeo, where you can see scads of
      cartoons I've made. <a href="https://vimeo.com/rossozarka">Click here!</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Can I get an animation of my own?</h2>
    <p>
      Absolutely, send me an email at ross.ozarka at gmail dot com and let's
      discuss your vision!
    </p>

    <h2>
      Can I see an episode of Kea Kids News? Can I see how you make your
      animations?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can do both at once, all you need to do is
